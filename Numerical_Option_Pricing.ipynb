    "The model has the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The asset price follows Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) whose percentage returns have a constant drift $\\mu$ and volatility $\\sigma$.** Apparently it was [Mandelbrot](https://is.muni.cz/el/1456/podzim2009/MPM_AEMM/um/Mandelbrot_-_Forecasts_Of_Future_Price_Unbiased_Markets_And_Martingale_Model.pdf) who first suggested that asset prices be modelled as martingales. It is then perhaps no surprise that his student, Eugene Fama, is seen as the father of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). The weak form of EMH is essentially the economic analogue of Mandelbrot's mathematical insight. That is, historical prices are useless at predicting the future and instead the current asset price reflects all available information. If we assume that prices are martingales then Levyâ€™s Characterization Theorem suggests that we should expect them to follow some time-changed Brownian Motion, underlining the ubiquity of this model. Of course, standard Brownian Motion (with no time change) is not a suitable model as it could predict negative asset prices. In addition, the expected percentage return on an investment would not be independent of the underlying asset price - as one experiences in real markets. For example, we observe no relationship between annual percentage returns on real assets and their absolute asset price. GBM addresses both of these problems: it implies that the percentage returns follow a Normal Distribution whilst the asset price itself has a Log-Normal Distribution. This model obviously has its limitations - see Extensions at the end. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Percentage returns are independent.** This is really just another assumption underlying the GBM model of asset prices but it is often overlooked. Another way to state this is that GBM is Markovian or *memoryless*. That is, the probability distribution of future prices is dependent only on the current price and not on any historical prices. Note that this is subtly different to being a martingale, which states that the expectation of future prices is dependent only on the current price (and is infact equal to it) and does not depend on any historical prices. In general neither property implies the other. The weak form of EMH is essentially a combination of the Markovian and martingale assumptions. The generally accepted phenomenon of *momentum* (the tendency for rising assets to continue rising and falling assets to continue falling) contradicts both of these assumptions. Such anomalies are best explained by the cognitive theorems of Behavioural Economics. Whilst a Markov process must be completely memoryless, a martingale need only have a memoryless expectation. For this reason, in the context of financial markets, the Markovian assumption seems more difficult to justify. The phenomenon of volatility clustering (the tendency for large changes to follow large changes and small changes to follow small changes) contradicts solely the Markovian assumption. Note that this was also first observed by [Mandelbrot](https://www.unc.edu/~fbaum/teaching/articles/MandelbrotCottonPrices1967.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Percentage returns are stationary.** This is also just another assumption underlying the GBM model of asset prices. A single definition of stationarity has never been quite decided upon by the mathematical community but in general a process is stationary if its statistical properties are invariant of time. In the context of option pricing this usually refers to the volatility of the asset. One can readily show that this is not constant in reality and many models have been proposed to confront this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The market is efficient and so no arbitrage opportunities exist.** The PDE is derived assuming this and can then be solved using a suitable transformation. A much easier approach is to employ The Fundamental Theorems of Asset Pricing which imply that a unique *risk-neutral* probability measure exists if a market is complete (negligible transaction costs and a price for every asset) and arbitrage-free. One can then reach the solution of the PDE immediately by using this measure to calculate the discounted expectation of the option's payout. See the Monte Carlo section for further discussion on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **There exists a riskless asset with a constant rate of return $r$.** This is typically taken as LIBOR.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **$S$ is a continuous variable.** That is, asset prices are continuously divisible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "In using the Fundamental Theorems of Asset Pricing we have implicitly assumed an efficient market in which no arbitrage opportunities exist. Here we have also assumed GBM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree and finite difference methods considered thus far required us to work backwards from the maturity date to the present. Instead Monte Carlo methods simulate paths of the asset price forwards in time. This means that they can be used to price exotic options whereby the payoff depends on the path followed by the underlying (e.g. Asian Options).\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo has probably been the slowest pricing method in this simple vanilla case. However, the method is embarassingly parallel and could easily be sped up using multithreading. In addition, Monte Carlo becomes particularly efficient if the payoff depends on multiple underlyings (e.g. a Basket Option) or if the underlying is itself a function of several other, probably correlated, stochastic processes (e.g. fx rates, inflation). In these cases the complexity increases linearly with the number of variables, rather than exponentially for the other two methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "One drawback of Monte Carlo is that, in simulating forwards, it cannot easily cope with American Options. However, it can most easily incorporate more sophisticated asset pricing models, other than GBM.\n"
